                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Chargebacks are constantly becoming a major threat to online business, so don’t let chargebacks affect
                        your business bottom line. As a business owner, you might be probably thinking one chargeback doesn’t
                        sound too bad. However, it can quickly add up and impact the bottom line of any growing business
                        and lead to closure of merchant accounts.

                    <h3 class="uppercase">Chargeback Prevention Management</h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Any Merchant Account faces a risk of getting closed when the chargeback ratio is more than the bank’s
                        set threshold, which in turn will impact the businesssales and growth and would also never be able
                        to get another merchant account under the same corp. Chargeback Alerts are key to stop the chargeback
                        before it hits the merchant account.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Acquiring a merchant account is an extremely strenuous task. In order to run an ecommerce business, a
                        merchant must have a merchant account to process the customer’s card payments to complete the sales.
                        On top of opening a merchant account the merchant must also need to team up with a payment gateway
                        to authorize the payment.<br>&nbsp;

                            <p>Chargebacks are constantly becoming a major threat to online business, so don’t let chargebacks
                                affect your business bottom line. As a business owner, you might be probably thinking one
                                chargeback doesn’t sound too bad. However, it can quickly add up and impact the bottom line
                                of any growing business and lead to closure of merchant accounts.

                            <h4>What is a chargeback?</h4>
                            <p> Chargeback in simpler terms is a dispute raised by a card holder (via their issuing bank) against
                                the merchant, to initiate a refund for a purchase made on their card. In the chargeback process,
                                the burden of proof lies with the merchant. The merchant will be given an opportunity to
                                provide supporting documentation to prove the legitimacy of the transaction. If the merchant
                                is successful, the transaction is credited back to his account. If the merchant is unsuccessful,
                                or does not respond in a timely fashion, they will be financially responsible for returning
                                funds to the consumer who filed the dispute. Reasons for Chargeback There are many reasons
                                why a cardholder may dispute the transaction and cause a chargeback to your merchant account.

                            <p>Acquiring a merchant account is an extremely strenuous task. In order to run an ecommerce business,
                                a merchant must have a merchant account to process the customer’s card payments to complete
                                the sales. On top of opening a merchant account the merchant must also need to team up with
                                a payment gateway to authorize the payment.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Why an Alerts services?</h4>
                            <p>Any Merchant Account faces a risk of getting closed when the chargeback ratio is more than the
                                bank’s set threshold, which in turn will impact the business sales and growth and would also
                                never be able to get another merchant account under the same corp. Chargeback Alerts are
                                key to stop the chargeback before it hits the merchant account.
                            </p>

                            <h4>How will Chargeback Alerts help merchants prevent chargebacks?</h4>
                            <p> A Chargeback Alert is a notification from a network of banks in real time letting you know that
                                a potential fraud transaction has been confirmed by the issuing bank or a customer has initiated
                                a dispute. This real time notification will give you the opportunity to accept and refund
                                the alert there by will preventing the chargeback from hitting your account.
                            </p>
                            <p>When you are a merchant, you need chargeback alerts and a chargeback management program that
                                will help you take immediate steps to stop chargeback through alerts, prevent chargebacks
                                and avoid chargeback fees.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Why Chargeback Patrols?</h4>
                            <p>We help preventing the chargeback for both fraud and non-fraud chargebacks. Patrols have a dedicated
                                team working 24/7 to process the refund for the alert. To avoid chargebacks, refunds must
                                be processed within 24 hours of receiving the alert – this includes alerts received on the
                                weekends and holidays. If an alerts are not processed within the 24 hour window they turn
                                in to chargebacks and in turn increase the risk level leading to closure of the merchant
                                account.

                                be accurate or reliable. You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite
                                periods of time or cancel the service at any time, without notice to you. You expressly agree

                                permitted by law.
